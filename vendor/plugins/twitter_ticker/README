TwitterTicker
=============
Embed a Twitter Feed into your application.

A generator is available for copying relevant images, a javascript file and a css file to the public directory.

	./script/generate twitter_ticker 

** IMPORTANT **
Include 'twitter_ticker.js' in your layout. 
Requires prototype and scriptaculous.
Not set to run on IE6 (too late to debug -perhaps tomorrow). Checked on IE7 and FF 3.0.7

Example
=======

Insert into your views (where feed is wanted):

	<%= display_twitter_ticker(:query => 'whales') %>
	
Options include: 
	:query - Find tweets containing this word
	:speed - (crawl, walk, run or sprint ). Default is 'walk'. How quickly tweets are replaced.
	:from_user - fetch tweets from a specific user. This option overrides :query.
	:auto (true|false) - reveal panel automatically when page loads. Default is false
